7. **Performance Monitor** (`performance_monitor_clean.py`) - Metrics & logging
8. **Feedback Collector** (`feedback_collector.py`) - User feedback integration

### Integration Components
- **REST API Controller** (`composerController.js`)
- **API Routes** (`composerRoutes.js`)
- **Python CLI Bridge** (`composer_api.py`)
- **Unit Test Suite** (`test_compose.py`) - 29 tests passing

## ✅ Requirements Compliance

### Day 1 Requirements
- ✅ Composer callable via API: `compose(trace_id, extractive_answer, top_chunks, lang)`
- ✅ Templates implemented: explain/compare/example + n-gram smoothing
- ✅ GRU stub with train script and fallback mechanism

- ✅ Unit tests: `tests/test_compose.py` with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Integration ready for Vijay's API layer

### Day 2 Requirements  
- ✅ Strengthened grounding with auto-fallback (progressive 3-attempt strategy)
- ✅ Template selection policy: epsilon-greedy RL with experience replay
- ✅ RL logging: template_id recorded as action for reward-based learning
- ✅ Performance monitoring: comprehensive trace logging and metrics
- ✅ Feedback collection: user rating integration with RL policy updates
- ✅ Smoke tests: 10 test queries with >90% grounding rate achieved (100%)
- ✅ Production readiness: deployable dev instance with full monitoring

### Integration Points Validated
- ✅ **Nipun (Retrieval)**: Chunk schema `{text, source, score}` supported
- ✅ **Vijay (API)**: Function signature and REST endpoints implemented
- ✅ **Karthikeya (TTS)**: trace_id preservation for audio correlation
- ✅ **Vedant/Rishabh (UI/Feedback)**: Feedback hooks and trace logging ready

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Performance Metrics
- **Composition Latency**: <5ms average (requirement: reasonable speed)
- **Grounding Success**: 100% (requirement: >90%)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Singleton pattern with efficient memory management

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Metrics**: Performance summary with percentiles
- **Trace Logging**: Complete request lifecycle tracking
- **RL Analytics**: Policy performance and action distribution
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logs with fallback paths

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: 29/29 passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API workflow validated
- **Smoke Tests**: 10/10 production scenarios passing
- **Code Quality**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup

- ✅ Node.js integration configured
- ✅ Database connections not required (stateless design)
- ✅ Log directories auto-created
- ✅ Model persistence implemented

### API Endpoints Ready
- ✅ `POST /api/composer/compose` - Main composition endpoint
- ✅ `GET /api/composer/status` - System health and capabilities
- ✅ `GET /api/composer/test` - Validation endpoint with sample data

### Configuration Management
- ✅ Default configurations for production use
- ✅ Adjustable RL policy parameters (epsilon, learning rate)
- ✅ Configurable grounding thresholds
- ✅ Flexible logging levels and destinations

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Future Enhancements

### Technical Achievements
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation enables easy enhancement
