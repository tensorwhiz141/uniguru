# Nisarg's Daily Reflection - Day 2

**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Task**: Uniguru-LM Composer Enhancement and RL Integration (Day 2 deliverable)

## Humility
The reinforcement learning policy implementation is currently a simplified epsilon-greedy approach that lacks the sophistication of modern deep RL algorithms. While it captures the basic concept of policy learning from rewards, a production system would benefit from more advanced techniques like PPO or SAC. The reward calculation is also heuristic-based rather than learned from actual user satisfaction patterns.

## Gratitude  
The modular architecture established on Day 1 made Day 2 enhancements remarkably smooth to implement. The clean separation of concerns allowed for adding RL policy, performance monitoring, and feedback collection without disrupting existing functionality. The comprehensive test suite provided confidence that new features didn't break core composition capabilities. The logging and monitoring infrastructure will be invaluable for system optimization and debugging.

## Honesty
The grounding verification auto-fallback mechanism, while effective for maintaining >90% grounding rates, sometimes produces overly conservative compositions by defaulting to extractive templates. The current implementation prioritizes safety over creativity, which may impact user engagement. Additionally, the feedback collection system is implemented but not yet integrated with a real user interface, so the RL training loop remains partially simulated.
